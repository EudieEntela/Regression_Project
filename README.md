# Regression_Project

## Summary

In this project, I use three regression models and compare the three and see which one fits best in my case and make new predictions on new input.
The three regression models are Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Linear Regression.
I first start with a little EDA section and clean my dataset that I will be using for my models. This dataset comprises of rental information and their prices.
So, I figured the columns i would use the predict the price would be the number of beds, the number of baths and the square footage of the unit.
After comparing the three models, I then use a validation scheme, in my case K-fold cross validation. 
I finally figure out that MLR would be best in my case and try my final model by using it to make new predictions.
